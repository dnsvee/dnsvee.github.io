		<h1>Gale-Shapley</h1>

		<p>So the problem posed is to match hospital and students (or any other similar problem) with each other. Each hospital prefers a student above all others and each student prefers a hospital above others. Ideally every hospital and student gets matched with their ideal partner. However this i soften impossible as two students may prefer to work at the same hospital. The goal is to match each hospital and student where the final solution has the property that each student is matched with a hospital and vica verse. There is no student and hospital pair where both prefer to be matched with each other above the partners they have been matched with.</p>
		<p>So some random data is generated where city names represent hospitals and random names are generated representing the students.</p>
