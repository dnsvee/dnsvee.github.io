# HTML_CSS_JS

Implementing some algorithms in Javascript and HTML. Needs a Node.js server to run. Algorithms implemented:

* Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Heap sort
* Maze generation using methods based on Kruskals, Recursive backtracking and recursive division
* The zebra puzzle from RosettaCode
* A* search algorithm  (doesnt work right)
* Edit distance, Knapsack, Longest Common subsequence

I am now hosting these things via GitHub pages [here](https://dnsvee.github.io)
