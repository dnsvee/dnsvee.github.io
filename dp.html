		<h3>Knapsack Problem 1/0</h3>
		<div id='agrid'>
			<p>The Knapsack problem asks for a given set of items with each item having a cost factor (like weight) and a value factor indicating how important or valued this item is how to maximize the value of a subset of items all the while limiting the total cost to a certain maximum amount.</p>
